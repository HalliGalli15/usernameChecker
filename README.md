This project was build in Angular 11 with NebularUI. This project was created to improve my regex skills and API-Requests.

With the "usernameChecker" you can search for a Username and see where it's used and where it's still free to use. Some future functions will include that you can see if it's a celebrety Username or a private Usernamen. When enough time a feature to create a account with this Username if not picked is planned.


## Service
In the moment there are these sites supported:

- Twitter
- Youtube
- Github
- Facebook
- Instagram
- Stackoverflow
- ... more are coming


## Development
It behave like a normal Angular-Applikation. To start the development server run `ng serve` and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. Because a external Theming is used (NebularUI) run `ng add @nebular/theme` if it isn't already installed. To use the full potential you need a stable internet connection.
